# The points P (x_1, y_1) and Q (x_2, y_2) are plotted at
# integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0),
# to form Î”OPQ.

# There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right
# angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between
# 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,

# 0 <= x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 <= 2.

# Given that 0 <= x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 <= 50, how many right
# triangles can be formed?
