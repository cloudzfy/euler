# Let p(n) represent the number of different ways in whichn coins can
# be separated into piles. For example, five coins can be separated
# into piles in exactly seven different ways, so p(5) = 7.

# OOOOO
# OOOO O
# OOO OO
# OOO O O
# OO OO O
# OO O O O
# O O O O O

# Find the least value of n for which p(n) is divisible by one million.
