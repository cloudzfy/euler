# In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.

#     1   1   1
#     - + - = -
#     x   y   n

# For n = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:

#     1    1   1
#     - + -- = -
#     5   20   4

#     1    1   1
#     - + -- = -
#     6   12   4

#     1   1   1
#     - + - = -
#     8   8   4

# What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct
# solutions exceeds one-thousand?

# NOTE: This problem is an easier version of Problem 110; it is
# strongly advised that you solve this one first.
