# A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

# a^2 + b^2 = c^2
# For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.

# There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
# Find the product abc.

for a in range(0, 1001):
	for b in range(a + 1, 1001):
		c = 1000 - a - b
		if b < c and a * a + b * b == c * c:
			print a * b * c
