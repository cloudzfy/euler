# A row measuring seven units in length has red blocks with a minimum
# length of three units placed on it, such that any two red blocks
# (which are allowed to be different lengths) are separated by at
# least one black square. There are exactly seventeen ways of doing
# this.

# How many ways can a row measuring fifty units in length be filled?

# NOTE: Although the example above does not lend itself to the possibility,
# in general it is permitted to mix block sizes. For example, on a row
# measuring eight units in length you could use red (3), black (1), and
# red (4).
