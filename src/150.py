# In a triangular array of positive and negative integers, we wish to
# find a sub-triangle such that the sum of the numbers it contains is
# the smallest possible.

# In the example below, it can be easily verified that the marked
# triangle satisfies this condition having a sum of âˆ’42.

#     [../img/p150.gif]

# We wish to make such a triangular array with one thousand rows, so
# we generate 500500 pseudo-random numbers s_k in the range +/-2^19,
# using a type of random number generator (known as a Linear
# Congruential Generator) as follows:

#     t := 0
#     for k = 1 up to k = 500500: 
#         t := (615949 * t + 797807) modulo 2^20
#         s_k := t - 2^19

# Thus: s_1 = 273519, s_2 = -153582, s_3 = 450905 etc

# Our triangular array is then formed using the pseudo-random numbers
# thus:

#              s_1
#           s_2   s_3
#        s_4   s_5   s_6
#     s_7   s_8   s_9   s_10
#              ...

# Sub-triangles can start at any element of the array and extend down
# as far as we like (taking-in the two elements directly below it from
# the next row, the three elements directly below from the row after
# that, and so on).

# The "sum of a sub-triangle" is defined as the sum of all the elements
# it contains.

# Find the smallest possible sub-triangle sum.
