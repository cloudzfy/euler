# The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is
# made up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has
# a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.

# Let d_1 be the 1st digit, d_2 be the 2nd digit, and so on. In this
# way, we note the following:

# d_2 * d_3 * d_4 = 406 is divisible by 2
# d_3 * d_4 * d_5 = 063 is divisible by 3
# d_4 * d_5 * d_6 = 635 is divisible by 5
# d_5 * d_6 * d_7 = 357 is divisible by 7
# d_6 * d_7 * d_8 = 572 is divisible by 11
# d_7 * d_8 * d_9 = 728 is divisible by 13
# d_8 * d_9 * d_10 = 289 is divisible by 17

# Find the sum of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property.
