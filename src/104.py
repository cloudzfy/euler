# The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

# F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}, where F_1 = 1 and F_2 = 1.
# It turns out that F541, which contains 113 digits, is the first
# Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital
# (contain all the digits 1 to 9, but not necessarily in order). And
# F_{2749}, which contains 575 digits, is the first Fibonacci number
# for which the first nine digits are 1-9 pandigital.

# Given that F_k is the first Fibonacci number for which the first
# nine digits AND the last nine digits are 1-9 pandigital, find k.
