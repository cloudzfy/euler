# Consider the isosceles triangle with base length, b = 16, and
# legs, L = 17.

#     [../img/p138.gif]

# By using the Pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height
# of the triangle, h = sqrt(172 âˆ’ 82) = 15, which is one less than
# the base length.

# With b = 272 and L = 305, we get h = 273, which is one more than
# the base length, and this is the second smallest isosceles
# triangle with the property that h = b +/- 1.

# Find sum(L) for the twelve smallest isosceles triangles for which
# h = b +/- 1 and b, L are positive integers.
