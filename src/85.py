# By counting carefully it can be seen that a rectangular
# grid measuring 3 by 2 contains eighteen rectangles:

#   #--    ##-    ###
#   ---    ---    ---
#    6      4      2

#   #--    ##-    ###
#   #--    ##-    ###
#    3      2      1

# Although there exists no rectangular grid that contains
# exactly two million rectangles, find the area of the grid
# with the nearest solution.
